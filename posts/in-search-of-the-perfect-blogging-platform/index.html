    <p>What makes a good blogging platform?</p>

<p>Leaving the tech details, feature lists and other bells and whistles
aside, a good blogging platform&rsquo;s primary aim is twofold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make blogging enjoyable. Entice the blogger into writing more articles.</li>
<li>Make reading enjoyable. The output of the blogging platform should be easy
to consume. A good support for themes and customization is a must.</li>
</ol>

<p>I had been using <a href="https://github.com/rigoneri/syte">Syte</a> as my homepage.
<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> was the underlying blogging platform and
the whole thing was hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. As it turns
out, all three of my aforementioned choices were sub-optimal as far as my
blogging requirements were considered.</p>

<ol>
<li>Syte was difficult to configure. I am neither a designer nor a front-end
developer. Therefore it just lay stagnant, with the default theme.</li>
<li>Tumblr was not a good choice for a tech blog. Writing and highlighting code
snippets is painful. Especially with a language like python, which uses
indentation for denoting scope and one incorrect word-wrap in your theme
can ruin the snippet. As it turns out, I churned out exactly two articles
during my time on Tumblr. It is a great platform for other things, not for a
tech blog in my humble opinion.</li>
<li>Though Heroku takes a lot of pain out of hosting your blog, it is far from
ideal. I had to shift my site because I received a dreaded <em>Application Error</em>
from Heroku. I had not looked into my site for a <em>very</em> long time and did
not want to investigate.</li>
</ol>

<p>A culmination of these problems forced me to look for alternatives. Thankfully,
I stumbled on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I cannot recommend
them more. The setup is absolutely simple and your blog/site can be up and
running in no time.</p>

<p>However, I faced a few problems with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Since,
it is based on Ruby, its installation was a nightmare for me due to the myriad
dependency management issues in Ruby. I naively tried
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> but later came to know that it was based
on Jekyll. (As a side, the dependency hell was primarily due to
<a href="http://bundler.io/blog/2014/07/16/bundler-api-outages.html">Bundler API outages</a>).</p>

<p>By this time, I had become really interested in the idea of static site
generators. Being a python fan, I searched for a python based solution and
found <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. It is fast, has good support
for themes and integrates with GitHub Pages with minimal effort from one&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>The results of half a day of hacking is this blog.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Comments are welcome.</p>
