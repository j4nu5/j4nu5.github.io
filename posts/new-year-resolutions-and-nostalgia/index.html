			<p>I was going through this <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things">link</a>
today when I could not help but feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and
incompleteness.</p>
<p>I will be graduating in May, 2013 from the Indian Institute of Technology,
Varanasi. The best 4 years of my life already behind me. As I was going
through this list, I found a lot of things I wish I could have done, many
others I wish I had done in a better fashion and many still that I have to do.</p>
<p>One of the things, though not on the above list has been this blog, which I had
been procrastinating about for nearly a couple of years.
So, here goes nothing &hellip;</p>
<p>Hope to start this New Year with resolutions and promises fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
