      <description>What makes a good blogging platform?
Leaving the tech details, feature lists and other bells and whistles aside, a good blogging platform&amp;rsquo;s primary aim is twofold:
 Make blogging enjoyable. Entice the blogger into writing more articles. Make reading enjoyable. The output of the blogging platform should be easy to consume. A good support for themes and customization is a must.  I had been using Syte as my homepage. Tumblr was the underlying blogging platform and the whole thing was hosted on Heroku.</description>

      <description>I was going through this link today when I could not help but feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and incompleteness.
I will be graduating in May, 2013 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi. The best 4 years of my life already behind me. As I was going through this list, I found a lot of things I wish I could have done, many others I wish I had done in a better fashion and many still that I have to do.</description>
