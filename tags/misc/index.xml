&lt;p>Leaving the tech details, feature lists and other bells and whistles
aside, a good blogging platform&amp;rsquo;s primary aim is twofold:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make blogging enjoyable. Entice the blogger into writing more articles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make reading enjoyable. The output of the blogging platform should be easy
to consume. A good support for themes and customization is a must.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I had been using &lt;a href="https://github.com/rigoneri/syte">Syte&lt;/a> as my homepage.
&lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr&lt;/a> was the underlying blogging platform and
the whole thing was hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku&lt;/a>. As it turns
out, all three of my aforementioned choices were sub-optimal as far as my
blogging requirements were considered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Year Resolutions and Nostalgia</title><link>https://sinhak.dev/posts/new-year-resolutions-and-nostalgia/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sinhak.dev/posts/new-year-resolutions-and-nostalgia/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was going through this &lt;a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/50_things">link&lt;/a>
today when I could not help but feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and
incompleteness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will be graduating in May, 2013 from the Indian Institute of Technology,
Varanasi. The best 4 years of my life already behind me. As I was going
through this list, I found a lot of things I wish I could have done, many
others I wish I had done in a better fashion and many still that I have to do.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
