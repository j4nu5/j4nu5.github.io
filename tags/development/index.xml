      <title>The Reliable Engineer</title>

      <description>A friend recently told me that he is focusing on becoming a reliable engineer, and wanted my opinion on this topic. Reliability has probably been my strongest attribute as an employee so I felt somewhat qualified to write about it.
What is Reliability? One of the lenses through which I view my job is as a service that I provide to my immediate manager. This is different from any additional obligations that I may have to my employer.</description>

      <title>Const References to Temporary Objects</title>

      <description>Consider the following code snippet:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  #include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt; int GetInt() { int x = 1; return x; } int main() { const int&amp;amp; x = GetInt(); std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl; return 0; }   In particular, pay attention to line #9. Is it guaranteed to be safe?
In this case, the answer is yes. The C++ standard guarantees that binding a temporary to a const reference on the stack, extends the lifetime of the temporary to the lifetime of the const reference.</description>

      <description>Facebook recently organized the qualification round of Hacker Cup 2015. They posed some interesting problems and anyone who could get at least one problem right can move to the next round.
I managed to get a rank of 217, with a perfect score of 100. I have posted my solutions below with a little bit of commentary. You can access the problems here.
Cooking the Books (15 points) This was the easiest question.</description>

      <description>Abstract Classes are one of the most useful and important concepts in Object Oriented Programming. I&amp;rsquo;ll attempt to illustrate their usefulness, and their usage in Python 2.7 with the following (seemingly contrived) example:
Let us say, you want/have to implement posting updates on Facebook using Python. Your code might look something like this:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  # Attempt 0: Bad code. def facebook_share_init(*args, **kwargs): # Initialize OAuth with facebook # .</description>
