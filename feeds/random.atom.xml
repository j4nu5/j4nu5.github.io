&lt;p&gt;Leaving the tech details, feature lists and other bells and whistles
aside, a good blogging platform&amp;#8217;s primary aim is&amp;nbsp;twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make blogging enjoyable. Entice the blogger into writing more&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make reading enjoyable. The output of the blogging platform should be easy
to consume. A good support for themes and customizations is a&amp;nbsp;must.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rigoneri/syte"&gt;Syte&lt;/a&gt; as my hompage.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; was the underlying blogging platform and
the whole thing was hosted on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns
out, all three of my aforementioned choices were suboptimal as far as my
blogging requirements were&amp;nbsp;considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syte was difficult to configure. I am neither a designer nor a front-end
developer. Therefore it just lay stagnant, with the default&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tumblr was not a good choice for a tech blog. Writing and highlighting code
snippets is painful. Especially with a language like python, which uses
indentation for denoting scope and one incorrect word-wrap in your theme
can ruin the snippet. As it turns out, I churned out exactly two articles
during my time on Tumblr. It is a great platform for other things, not for a
tech blog in my humble&amp;nbsp;opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though Heroku takes a lot of pain out of hosting your blog, it is far from
ideal. I had to shift my site because I received a dreaded &lt;em&gt;Application Error&lt;/em&gt;
from Heroku. I had not looked into my site for a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long time and did
not want to&amp;nbsp;investigate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A culmination of these problems forced me to look for alternatives. Thankfully,
I stumbled on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot recommend
them more. The setup is absolutely simple and your blog/site can be up and
running in no&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I faced a few problems with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. Since,
it is based on Ruby, its installation was a nightmare for me due to the myriad
dependency management issues in Ruby. I naively tried
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://octopress.org/"&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; but later came to know that it was based
on Jekyll. (As a side, the dependency hell was primarily due to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bundler.io/blog/2014/07/16/bundler-api-outages.html"&gt;Bundler &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; outages&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, I had become really interested in the idea of static site
generators. Being a python fan, I searched for a python based solution and
found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. It is fast, has good support
for themes and integrates with GitHub Pages with minimal effort from one&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of half a day of hacking is this&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. Comments are&amp;nbsp;welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

overwhelming sense of sadness and&amp;nbsp;incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be graduating in May, 2013 from the Indian Institute of Technology,
Varanasi. The best 4 years of my life already behind me. As I was going
through this list, I found a lot of things I wish I could have done, many
others I wish I had done in a better fashion and many still that I have to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things, though not on the above list has been this blog, which I had
been procrastinating about for nearly a couple of years. So, here goes nothing&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to start this New Year with resolutions and promises&amp;nbsp;fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for&amp;nbsp;reading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="new year resolutions"></category><category term="nostalgia"></category></entry></feed>
