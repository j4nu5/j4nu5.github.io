overwhelming sense of sadness and incompleteness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be graduating in May, 2013 from the Indian Institute of Technology,
Varanasi. The best 4 years of my life already behind me. As I was going
through this list, I found a lot of things I wish I could have done, many
others I wish I had done in a better fashion and many still that I have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of things, though not on the above list has been this blog, which I had
been procrastinating about for nearly a couple of years. So, here goes nothing ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to start this New Year with resolutions and promises fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="new year resolutions"></category><category term="nostalgia"></category></entry></feed>
